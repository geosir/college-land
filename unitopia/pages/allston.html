<h1>Arranging Allston</h1>
<p>In recent years, Harvard has been making news in Allston by putting forth development plans for the large amounts of
    land it owns there. Collected through various gifts and purchases in the 20th century, much of the land remains
    vacant, awaiting attention for future University use. However, as the SEAS Expanded Campus nears its opening in
    2020, the influx of student traffic will undoubtedly spur interest in improving commerce and amenities in the
    area—aspects which Harvard has near-total control over, as they own all the land surrounding the Expanded Campus.
    This article provides a brief history of the College’s land acquisitions in Allston, examines an interesting area of
    current use, and briefly speculates what the University might do in the coming years as it moves to accommodate the
    Expanded Campus.</p>

<h2>Campus Dreams</h2>
<p>Harvard acquired its position in Allston today over the course of more than a century. Its first parcel was a gift in
    the 1800s from famous poet and professor Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in an effort to preserve the tranquil riverfront
    from industrial development.<sup><a href="#r1">[1]</a></sup> The second parcel came from a failed 1904 plan to merge
    the
    Massachusetts Institute of Technology with the University; the resulting 1.3 million square feet of unused purchased
    by supporters like Andrew Carnegie for the relocated Institute was transferred to the College in 1918, where it
    would soon be developed into the Harvard Business School.<sup><a href="#r2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>But it was Harvard’s third foray into the Boston suburb that seems most characteristic of its modern position there.
    In 1997, the University admitted that between the years 1988 and 1994, it had used a number of front companies to
    secretly buy up 53 acres of land for $88 million; secrecy was necessary, the University believed, so that landowners
    would not artificially inflate prices if they knew that Harvard was buying. Through purchases like
    these, Harvard had increased its position in Allston to about 350 acres in modern day, compared to about just 200
    acres in Cambridge.<sup><a href="#r3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Obviously, Harvard’s tremendous presence in Allston has not been without controversy. Residents have feared that the
    University would simply leave the land vacant until it would come to future use...and it has. Still,
    Harvard’s planning has been nothing but ambitious. A 1999 plan proposed uniting the Allston campus with the
    Cambridge campus <i>by moving the course of the Charles river</i>.<sup><a href="#r4">[4]</a></sup> More recently in
    November 2018, Harvard
    has announced plans to develop the land into a brand-new Enterprise Research Campus.<sup><a href="#r5">[5]</a></sup>

<h2>Friendly Neighborhood Landlord</h2>
<p>Harvard has some very interesting present-day positions in Allston. Most notably, it owns a number of properties that
    are rented-out to external users, including Star Market, a popular supermarket frequented by students.</p>

</p>
<p>This might be a manifestation of Harvard’s plans to shape the amenities around its campus to benefit its affiliates
    and neighbors. A 1975 report by the North Allston/Harvard Land Use Task Force on development opportunities in
    Allston Landing indicated such goals, with proposals of creating office parks, housing, parks, and shops to provide
    convenient resources to the Allston community.<sup><a href="#r6">[6]</a></sup> By retaining ownership of land in
    prime
    areas around its campus, it seems likely that the University will be able to direct what types of amenities are
    placed where—and perhaps even attract business desirable to affiliates, like restaurants and supermarkets, through
    incentives like subsidized rent.</p>

<h2>Looking Forward</h2>
<p>With the opening of the SEAS Expanded Campus in 2020, it seems that Harvard is poised to grow its general campus into
    North Allston through the mid-21st century. Since it already owns a significant amount of land there, it seems
    possible that the worst of the growing pangs are in the past as the University is no longer grappling with local
    residents for land itself. That being said, there will certainly be future conversations on zoning and the use of
    land; but if handled well, Harvard can position itself as a strong community benefactor that can jumpstart the local
    economy of North Allston and improve the built space there for Harvard affiliates and residents alike.</p>
