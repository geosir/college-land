<h1>Conclusions</h1>

<p>As an institution whose success is equivalent to the success of its students and faculty, the university has every
    incentive to do all it can to prove the best facilities possible to its affiliates. In the United States, where
    urbanism is strongly driven by American frontier ideals (as we have learned in <i>Designing the American City</i>),
    and in particular, a conviction that fallow land can be improved indefinitely to yield ever-greater fruit, we find
    that the American university takes a proactive role shaping its surrounding community to meet the needs of its
    affiliates.</p>
<p>Our observations of Harvard are an extreme case of this development in action. As the wealthiest university in the
    country, Harvard has unsurprisingly had great success in developing a campus rooted in purposeful design; besides
    the historic projects mentioned previously, the University has rerouted a major roadway so that it could connect the
    Yard to its science labs and opened the Smith Campus Center as a gathering space for students and the public
    alike.</p>

<p>But although Harvard’s projects in land development are largest in magnitude, it certainly is not the sole
    institution actively engaged in urban planning. In recent years, MIT has taken interest in development projects of
    its own, such as an initiative to renew its neighboring Kendall Square with residences, offices, and labs.<sup><a
            href="#r1">[1]</a></sup>
    And Northeastern, too, is prepping to unveil a new residence hall in Fall 2019.<sup><a href="#r2">[2]</a></sup>
    It seems from our discussion and recent examples that the drive to develop land for academic and residential is a
    defining feature of the American college town.</p>
<p>I hope that Unitopia has shed some light on the often hidden work undertaken by colleges to create a seamless
    experience of space for their affiliates. Already, by using the mobile version of the website and walking around, I
    have discovered some more property oddities, such as the fact that the Harvard Square Hotel is fully-owned by
    Harvard (no wonder it’s the hotel of choice when the school invites visitors!).<sup><a href="#r3">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>I hope that by making information like this more transparent,
    students, faculty, local residents, and other users of the space will come to better appreciate the rigorous
    planning undertaken by institutions like Harvard—as well as discover how they can have a say in the Unitopia around
    them.</p>
