<h1><a name="" href="#">Harvard and Home</a></h1>
<p>In the nearly 400 years of its existence, Harvard University has grown significantly. What began as a small, secluded
    space for classical study in quaint and pastoral Cambridge transformed over the 20th century into a bustling
    world-class research institution **Cite: Harvard History**. As part of this transformation, the university grew to
    encompass 12 degree-granting schools and more than 38,000 students and faculty **Cite: Harvard at a Glance**.
    Naturally, to accommodate all this progress, Harvard has needed to acquire a significant amount of land.
</p>
<p>Of particular interest is the manner in which the university surged into the neighboring areas of Cambridge starting
    in the early 1900s to house the growing number of students and faculty. Driven by the concurrent needs of three
    primary groups—undergraduates, married students, and faculty—the college made a number of calculated purchases and
    constructions during this period that resulted in the campus we interact with today. By observing these decisions,
    we may speculate what the university might to do to handle the housing conundrum it will imminently face as it
    expands its campus to Allston.</p>

<p>It is the dawn of the 20th century, and Harvard faces a problem: by 1900, enrollment had quadrupled since its
    founding to about 2,000 while the College’s primitive dormitories at the time could only fit one-third of that. The
    result was the entrenchment of inequality as the wealthiest students moved to apartments along the “Gold Coast,” an
    area lining Mt. Auburn St. including the buildings that comprise Adams House today (Figure 2). This was the
    inception of many of the “final” clubs in recent news, which notably are concentrated in the area where they once
    served as gathering and dining places for these wealthy elite **Cite: Harvard Observed**.</p>

<p>This was a thorn in the side of President Charles W. Eliot as he fought to open the college to all different levels
    of class throughout America; he wrote “I want to have the College open equally to men with much money, little money,
    or no money, provided they all have brains” **Cite: Harvard Observed 22**. Although this did not manifest in Eliot’s
    time as a push for more and equal housing (he instead championed capping tuition to relatively affordable levels),
    this spirit would continue into the agenda of his successor, President Lawrence Lowell, who sought to bring a system
    of Oxbridge-style colleges to Harvard **Cite: Harvard Observed 49**.</p>
<p>The first efforts to do this were relatively modest. In 1902, Edward Waldo Forbes, grandson of Ralph Waldo Emerson,
    had organized a consortium to purchase so-called “Riverside” land between Mt. Auburn St. and the Charles river for
    the university’s later use (see Figure 3)**Cite: Harvard Observed, Timeline Crimson**. A decade later, the
    University finally acquired the funds for new buildings on this site, and under Lowell’s direction, opened Standish
    and Gore Halls there in 1914. These would later be joined to create Winthrop House. **Cite: Harvard Observed 49,
    69**.</p>

<p>But it wasn’t until after WWI that progress on Lowell’s vision really began to pick up. As the war had diminished
    undergraduate enrollment, the Gold Coast apartments were left struggling—and therefore available for a bargain. It
    was during this time that the College gradually bought-out these formerly private and elite apartments, including
    Randolph, Westmorly, Claverly, and Apthorp Houses which would ultimately form Adams House **Cite: Adams House
    History**. By 1930, Harvard had essentially purchased the entire block (see Figure 4).</p>

<p>In 1928, President Lowell finally got the break he was looking for: Edward Harkness, a Yale alumnus frustrated by his
    alma mater’s resistance to building the residential house system which he believed to be the future of the American
    college, bequeathed $13 million to Harvard so that it could constrict its own. This gift allowed Lowell to acquire
    the land and resources to build seven residential Houses: three from the ground-up and four from the existing
    buildings of the Gold Coast and freshman dorms along the Riverside. These would become the seven original houses:
    Dunster, Eliot, Kirkland, Leverett, Adams, Lowell, and Winthrop. Many of these opened in 1930, creating the
    impressive swathe of Harvard territory along the river which we can still see today (see Figure 5). **Cite: Harvard

</div>
<p>By the middle of the century, Harvard had acquired a significant amount of prime real estate along the river.
    Naturally, this fundamentally changed the nature of the neighborhood: what used to be home to various private
    residents and businesses (Figure 3) was, over the course of just a few decades, completely cleared out and dominated
    by the College. In the Unitopia map, we see that these small parcels have largely been merged into gigantic plots
    owned by Harvard, illustrating the tremendous displacing power of a powerful, wealthy university.</p>
<h2><a name="married" href="#married">Married and Matriculating</a></h2>
<p>The 50s brought a brand new conundrum to the University: where to house all of these married students returning from
    the war? By 1955, Harvard had enrolled 2,160 married students but only had three housing complexes to keep them in:
    Shaler Lane, Gibson Terrace, and Holden Green **Cite: Apartment Wanted**. A 1955 article from the Harvard Alumni
    Bulletin (now the Harvard Magazine) illustrated the challenge:</p>
<p>The average married student is twenty-four years old, a veteran, working in one of the graduate schools, and living
    quite near his classrooms in an apartment carved out of a private house, for which he pays from $70 to $100 a month
    [About $664 and $949, respectively, in 2019 dollars]. Usually, he has no bedroom as such, but sleeps on a
    comfortable sofa. He tends to regard his present living quarters as a temporary expedient, until he can get into
    “Harvard housing” or find something better. Most of these students have no children. An increase in size of the
    family makes almost mandatory a change to larger quarters. **Cite: Apartment Wanted**</p>
<p> As a result, married students had begun helping themselves, from outright buying their own apartments nearby to more
    inventive solutions, including one instance of living out of a trailer in the Cambridge suburbs **Cite: Apartment
    Wanted**.</p>
<p>Thus, Harvard got to work. By 1965, Harvard had expanded its housing selection for married students to five
    complexes, whose locations (illustrated in Figure 6) simultaneously offered peaceful privacy and convenient
    proximity to the campus. A brochure on these housing offerings released that year noted well the University’s goals:
    “The Housing Office expects that its centralized services, together with the construction by Harvard of new
    apartment buildings, will enable Harvard people to obtain suitable facilities more readily and will also ease the
    housing situation generally in Cambridge” **Cite: Harvard’s Apartments for Married Students**. The College has
    certainly be diligent in that task; today, it owns a total of 62 properties through its Harvard University Housing

<p>One of the oldest properties, Shaler Lane, is in a fascinatingly odd spot: it is an island of high-quality mid-cost
    university housing surrounded by multi-million-dollar properties. In particular, rent for a single unit starts at
    about $2,000/month (including internet, laundry, and other utilities) **Cite: HUH while just a block over there
    reside properties of Brattle St. valued in excess of $6-7 million. How did this come to be? As it turns out, Shaler
    Lane was constructed by Harvard very early on in the booming 1920s **Cite: HUH**. Since then, it has held that
    property exempt from taxes (acccording to its 2019 assessment **Link:
    https://www.cambridgema.gov/propertydatabase/18825**), allowing it to retain a foothold there despite the rising
    land values in the area. Once again, Harvard’s presence in the well-to-do neighborhood, and more importantly, its
    ability to provide reasonably affordable housing there, stand as another testament to the ability of a wealthy
    university to provide for its affiliates.</p>

</div>
<p>(Research anecdote: I noticed Shaler Lane on the map when initially analyzing Harvard’s properties in the Cambridge
    area, and was piqued by how out-of-place it was. Naturally, I had to pay it a visit on foot. Walking into the
    private avenue, I was impressed by how demure it was from the outside and yet so distinctly Harvard on the inside,
    what with the red-brick color scheme and materials used for pavement and signage. It’s obvious that it was meant to
    fit into the neighborhood—there was no formal boundary or sign indicating that this was a Harvard property—and yet
    provide a sense of privacy and comfort to its residents. In particular, the small scale of the street and the
    inclusion of a tiny playground made it obvious that this was a desirable place for graduate students or associate
    professors to raise their young children.)
</p>
<h2><a name="faculty" href="#faculty">Faculty and the Brattle Street Bastion</a></h2>
<p>We’ve seen how Harvard University has changed the built space to provide for its students; now we will observe the
    ways in which it is supporting its faculty as well. In the present day, Harvard University Housing offers residences
    for faculty that are located convenient close to campus. Some examples of these are visible near the Quad, where a
    number of College-owned houses are listed as “in the care of” various professors at the school. **Click to center on
    faculty homes near the quad**</p>
<p>This is not new. According to a property map in a 1975 report on Harvard University’s long-range development plans, a
    decent number of individual houses as well as an apartment complex near the Radcliffe dorms were reserved
    exclusively for faculty and administration housing. The plan noted a clear intent in this design:</p>
<p>A greater number of graduate single and married students, University officers, and support staff should be house in
    University residential facilities near the University. Such facilities would relieve pressure on the housing supply
    in neighboring cities, would provide appropriate accommodation at reasonable rents, would reduce the need for
    commuting, and would decrease automobile use. This would also enhance a greater sense of University community.

</div>
<p>So by this time, the University was already poised to be a community influence in Cambridge.</p>
<p>However, one neighborhood has seen remarkably little influence from Harvard compared to other areas of similar
    distance from the campus center: Brattle Street. Despite the massive pushes by the University for undergraduate and
    then apartment housing in the 20th century, and despite the growing density of all of the neighborhoods around it
    (see Figure 10), Brattle Street remains a quiet, secluded neighborhood home to stately (sometimes ancient) mansions,
    tall leafy trees, and impervious privacy walls. How has this remained despite the powerful sway carried by the
    university and the convenient proximity of those properties to Harvard Square?</p>

    </p>
</div>
<p>The extraordinarily high assessment value of the properties suggests that these are the residences of the wealthy
    elite of Cambridge, so of course their community will hold significant political sway in blocking any zoning change
    that may endanger their neighborhood. Not that any should come their way from the University: inspecting the owners
    of these homes reveal that some of them are affiliates of Harvard itself, suggesting that the College may be
    preserving this neighborhood as a de facto enclave for its faculty and administrators—an attractive policy as it
    retains conveniently-close housing for the university elite while providing a screen of wealth and refinement
    (especially in architecture and landscaping) that sets these residents apart from the more common students and
    younger faculty **Cite: American College Town 99**.</p>
<h2><a name="conclusions" href="#conclusions">Conclusions</a></h2>
<p>Over the course of the 20th century, Harvard acquired a significant amount of land to accommodate the rapid growth of
    its stature as a world-renowned institution. These purchases and gifts not only allowed the University to come into
    intimate control over its immediate neighborhood, but it also demonstrated that the willingness of the College to
    invest in its affiliates, not only in terms of convenience, but also with respect to community-building as well.
    Although Harvard was not hegemonic in its territorial influence in those formative days—plenty of other wealthy or
    powerful groups such as final clubs, private housing organizations, and affluent communities have and still do stand
    in the way of the institution—its foray into urban planning then gave the school invaluable experience in raising
    funds and support for quite significant projects such as the House system.</p>
<p>In Fall 2020, the SEAS Expanded Campus will open in Allston **Cite: Harvard SEAS Allston** and the vast majority of
    engineering and applied sciences courses will be shifted to classrooms across the river. Anecdotally, there have
    been discussions on how this will impact student life, as students living the the Quad will need to make an
    enormously inconvenient commute to get to class; there has even been the suggestion that this might discourage
    students living in the Quad from concentrating in engineering and applied sciences. Furthermore, it is probable that
    engineering students will be spending a large amount of time in the labs and workshops in the new campus and
    therefore may wish to have convenient access to food and other amenities. Considerations like these make it highly
    probably that Harvard will consider some variety of further development in the immediate area of the SEAS Expanded
    Campus, commercial, residential, or both.</p>
<p>Speculating as an undergraduate student observing these changes, I believe it may be possible that in the next 10
    years, Harvard will relocate students living in the Quad to housing that is nearer to the river, either by swapping
    places with existing graduate housing like at Peabody Terrace, purchasing more housing along the river, or building
    new housing in the space it owns in Allston. The Quad is already quite isolated from regular student life, and there
    are perennial complaints as freshmen are assigned there even without having opened an Allston campus, so such a
    relocation may save the University a student-relations headache in the long run. It also seems very likely that as
    the Allston area becomes more trafficked by students that Harvard will increase its investment in supporting
    commercial activity around popular areas; I will discuss this further in **LINK Arranging Allson**.</p>
<p>In any case, Harvard has demonstrated a keen willingness to shape the land around it to benefit its affiliates, and
    it undoubtedly will continue this trend as it gradually capitalizes on its properties in Allson.</p>
