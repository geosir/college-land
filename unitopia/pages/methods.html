<h1>Methods</h1>
<p>Work on this project was fundamentally a treasure hunt, both for data as well as historical references on
    observations in the data. It involved gathering digital shape data for rendering the map; aggregating this data with
    property assessment data, which was provided separately; processing and stylizing the data; and finally compiling it
    into map image tiles for fast delivery. Once the Unitopia map was complete, the work of research involved
    discovering interesting properties and regions on the map and looking for library or online references which might
    explain those instances.</p>

<h2>Gathering the Data</h2>
<p>I began with Cambridge. First I obtained a
    <a target="_blank"
       href="https://github.com/cambridgegis/cambridgegis_data/blob/master/Assessing/FY2019/FY2019_Parcels/ASSESSING_ParcelsFY2019.geojson">GeoJSON
        file describing parcel boundaries</a> from the <a class="story-link" tabindex="0"
                                                          data-target="/references" data-hash="#cambridge_gis">Cambridge
        GIS Dataset GitHub</a>. These did not have property data, so I wrote <a target="_blank"
                                                                                href="https://github.com/geosir/unitopia/blob/gh-pages/scraping/merge_owners_cambridge.py">a
        script</a> to scrape property data from the <a class="story-link" tabindex="0"
                                                       data-target="/references" data-hash="#cambridge_property">Cambridge
        Property Database</a>. This took a long time to run (about a 1.5 days), and in hindsight, the data was also
    <a target="_blank"
       href="https://github.com/cambridgegis/cambridgegis_data/blob/master/Assessing/FY2019/FY2019_Parcels/ASSESSING_PropertyDatabase_FY2019.csv">available
        as a CSV file</a> in the same folder of the GitHub repository.
    The result of the script was one large GeoJSON file with populated assessment fields for each parcel shape.</p>
<p>Next was Boston, which sported a very similar process. I found the <a target="_blank"
                                                                         href="https://data.boston.gov/dataset/parcels-20181">GeoJSON
    file for the Boston parcels</a> from the <a class="story-link" tabindex="0" data-target="/references"
                                                data-hash="#boston_data">Boston Open Data Portal</a>. Then, after
    corresponding with the City of Boston Assessing Department, I was directed to an <a target="_blank"
                                                                                        href="https://data.boston.gov/dataset/property-assessment/resource/695a8596-5458-442b-a017-7cd72471aade">online
        record of their city assessment data</a>. Finally, I acquired a <a target="_blank"
                                                                           href="https://data.boston.gov/dataset/property-assessment/resource/d6c1268c-cd83-4dc3-a914-bba1ed59da6d">list
        of human-readable names</a> for property occupancy codes used in the assessment data in order to decode land
    use. Once again, I wrote <a target="_blank"
                                href="https://github.com/geosir/unitopia/blob/gh-pages/scraping/merge_owners_boston.py">a
        script</a> to combine all of these into one large GeoJSON file with populated assessment fields for each parcel
    shape.</p>

<h2>Working the Data</h2>
<p>To better visualize the data as I worked with it (and it do it efficiently, as all these shapes were slowing my
    browser), I uploaded the data to ArcGIS, which we have a free license for as Harvard affiliates. There, I was able
    to color the data according to the <a class="story-link" tabindex="0" data-target="/references" data-hash="#lbcs">LBCS
        standard</a>.
<p>This was also the stage in which I created the layers highlighting Harvard- and MIT-owned properties. This was
    accomplished by inspecting the recorded owner names of known Harvard and MIT properties and using those names to
    filter all of the properties by owner. This worked quite well and produced what looks to be most of the properties;
    however, especially in the case of Harvard, many more owned properties might be listed under other owner names that
    may be subsidiaries and can be quite obfuscated. Furthermore, the Boston ownership data was massively inconsistent,
    often listing the same owner in many different formats, truncations, and abbreviations, which was difficult to work
    with and may have resulted in missed data.</p>

<h2>Serving the Data</h2>
<p>After processing, the datasets for this project were on the order of several hundred megabytes; plus, displaying
    thousands of individual polygons representing properties was difficult for my browser. I needed to find a way to
    serve the data efficiently and lazilyâ€”that is, only load the data that was needed, and in a format that did not
    require drawing individual polygons.</p>
<p>The solution was to use ArcGIS services to compile the colored data layers into image map tiles. These loaded much
    faster as the map would only need tens of these tiles at any time, and each tile would represent a drawing of
    hundreds of shapes at once; plus, displaying images is much easier than drawing individual polygons.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, transparency information is lost on the current implementation of map tiles in Unitopia (which is why
    sometimes the streets are obscured by the land-usage colorings). For this reason, I did not compile the university
    property outlines to tiles lest they should obscure the coloring beneath them.</p>

<h2>Reference Roundup</h2>
<p>Once I had a good visualization, I looked around the map for properties in interesting places, as well as properties
    that surprised me to be owned by Harvard and MIT. I visited some of these properties on foot, such as Shaler Lane
    and the Co-Op. Then, I got to work at the Francis Loeb Library, looking for Harvard planning documents and maps that
    could give background on these interesting properties. The information I learned from these and other readings
    became the explanatory essays included with Unitopia.</p>
