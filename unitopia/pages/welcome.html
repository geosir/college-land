<h1><a name="" href="#">Welcome to Unitopia.</a></h1>
<p>
    The college town is a fascinating niche in American urban development. As a city dominated by a large educational
    institution working to support an ever-changing population of students, researchers, and faculty, the built-space of
    the college town is an on-going compromise between the dynamic needs of college affiliates, local residents, and the
    university institution itself. How do wealthy institutions shape their campuses and influence their periphery to
    meet their needs? What is the relationship between the school and the local government like? And how does all this
    planning and construction affect the experience of the people who live there?
</p>
<p>Shedding light on these questions is salient today as college towns become locuses for 21st century economic and
    technological development;<sup><a href="#r1">[1]</a></sup> understanding how the power struggle is unfolding between
    the
    increasingly-wealthy university and the growing number of young, affluent people living and working around the
    college will help urban planners predict what the American college town will look like as we approach the middle of
    the century.</p>
<p>
    <b>Unitopia</b> is a project that uses data visualization as an aide to explore leads to some of those questions. It
    is a discovery tool for ownership and land-use around a number of campuses in the Cambridge/Boston-area. With focus
    on Harvard, this project seeks to identify a selection of interesting areas, discuss their stories, and
    attempt to generalize them into future insights. So welcome to Unitopia: explore, read, and uncover the role of
    universities in shaping the space around them.
