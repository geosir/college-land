<h1>Welcome to Unitopia.</h1>
<p>
    The American college town is a lively place, a confluence of students, faculty, and tourists in a highly-dense and
    purposefully structured space. Naturally, the built space of these college towns will evolve over time to fit the
    needs of each of these groups. As university institutions grow and gain wealth, how exactly do they shape the land
    around their campuses to meet these needs? What is the relationship between the school and the local government
    like? And how does this planning and construction affect the experience of the people who inhabit it?
</p>
<p>
    <b>Unitopia</b> is a project to use data and visualization to suggest leads to some of these questions. It is a
    place to explore ownership and land-use around a number of campuses in the Cambridge/Boston area. With focus on
    Harvard, MIT, Boston University, and Northeastern, this project seeks to identify a selection of interesting areas,
    discuss their stories, and attempt to generalize them into future insights.
</p>
<p>So welcome to Unitopia: read, explore, and uncover the role of universities in shaping the space around them.</p>
